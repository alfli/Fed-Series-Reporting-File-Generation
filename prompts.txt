Generate a python program that will generate very large XML test files based a provided XSD (schema file), sample output file, 
and data dictionary and their relationships.

Pointers from chat:
   xmlschema: excellent for validation and dict↔XML conversions, but its encode workflows aren’t optimized for multi-GB streaming generation.

   Best pattern for your case: stream-generate with lxml.etree.xmlfile, and use xmlschema (or lxml XMLSchema) to validate a sample or periodic chunks.
    
   pip install lxml xmlschemaItemGroup logic
   from lxml import etree
   import xmlschema
   Uses lxml.etree.xmlfile to stream write (constant memory)
   Rotates files on a safe boundary (between big blocks)
   Uses xmlschema for validation (but only first file by default to keep runtime reasonable)The following groups (itemGroup) are defined

Group - Business Contact 
SHCAR069, key="yes", item value is sequence number SHCAC495, SHCAC496, SHCAB902, SHCA4086 

Group - ServiceProvider 
SHCAR070, key="yes", item value is sequence number 
SHCAN263 

Group - ValTechnique SHCAN448, key="yes", item value is a unique value of SHCAN448 in Schedule 2 
SHCAN449

For SHCAN448, just assign "RU1" or "RU2". Assign them to every other schedule 2 group generated.
As a result, only two entries in Group - ValTechnique will be generated.


Group - Schedule 3
SHCCN186, key="yes", item value is  sequence number
SHCCN478, SHCCN456, SHCCN457, SHCCN458, SHCCN459, SHCCN479, SHCCN480, SHCCN481, SHCCN482, SHCCN483, SHCCN484, SHCCN485

Group - Schedule 2
SHCDN186, key="yes", item value is  sequence number
SHCAN448, SHCDN460, SHCDN461, SHCDN462, SHCDN463, SHCDN464, SHCDN465, SHCDN466, SHCDN467, SHCDN468, SHCDN486, SHCDN470, SHCDN471, SHCDN487, SHCDN490, SHCDN472, SHCDN473, SHCDN474, SHCDN475, SHCDN477, SHCD9914

Each group can repeat with the destinated key like SHCCN186 and SHCDN186 having a incremental sequence number


Add the following item to the output, they don't belong to a group 
Summary of Schedule 2 
SHCAN450 Number of Group - Schedule 2 items 
SHCAN451 Total amount of SHCDN490 
SHCAN452 
SHCAN453 
SHCAN454 

Summary of Schedule 3 
SHCAN455 Number of Gruop - Schedule 3 items 
SHCAN456 Total amount of SHCCN459 
SHCAN457 
SHCAN458 
SHCAN459

Please add these items as well before writing out the summary and itemgroups
